Ok so this is my first github repo and I made the repo in the wrong folder.
So in order to get to the AlphaSlow files, go to src.
From there, the bot consists of 3 files:
  AlphaSlow.py to play the game using the parameters from parameters.py, 
  Training.py to train the neural network, and
  parameters.py to store the parameters from training.py
